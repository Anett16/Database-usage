# Database-usage

## 1. Questionnaire
I will try to create the questionnaire using umbuzoo (https//www.umbuzoo.de/). It was recommended to me but I am still open for other proposals. I will upload the questionaire after finishing.
With the questinnaire I will ask for the useres subjective evaluation of their database usage.

## 2. Google annalytics
The Idea using gaoogle analytics is to get an real usage counter for all the databases offert thourgh the library. And maybe as well more infomation about the kind of usage. 

## 3. publisher usage counter date
The third element of this analysis will be the usage counter data the publisher send to us. Some I receive once a month other only when I ask for them. But it should be possible to get this information. 

## 4. Analysis of these three elements
I think it could be interessting to see the different between the users subjective impression of using the databses and the real figures I will get from google analytics. (hope so) Maybe there are none differents. With the outcome of this comparation I will have a look of the data the publisher send to me and hopefully I find out if I can trust these data.

## 5. Where I need help
- I haven't worked with google analytics yet. I would be thankfull if someone could show me how to use this program. 
- Could someone recommend a program to evaluate the collected data. @Eva, maybe we could use poolparty? Then we would have a real project to see how it works.

## And
It wasn't my aim to take over allready the next meeting. But thanks for the pressure. I want finnish this project by end of November. So please do more of it!
