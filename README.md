# Database-usage

## 1. Questionnaire
I will try to create the questionnaire using umbuzoo (https//www.umbuzoo.de/). It was recommended to me. But I am still open for other proposals. I will upload the questionaire after finishing.
With the questinnaire I will ask the users subjective evaluation of their database usage.

## 2. Google annalytics
The idea using google analytics is to get a real usage counter for all the databases offered by the library. And maybe as well more infomation about the kind of usage. 

## 3. Publisher usage counter data
The third element of this analysis will be the usage counter data the publisher send to us. Some I receive once a month other only when I ask for them. But it should be possible to get this information. 

## 4. Analysis of these three elements
I think it could be interessting to see the different between the users subjective impression of using the databases and the real figures I will get from google analytics. (hope so) But maybe there are none differents. 
With the outcome of this comparation I will have a look at the data the publisher send to me and hopefully I find out if I can trust these data.

## 5. Where I need help
- I haven't worked with google analytics yet. I would be thankfull if someone could show me how to use this program. 
- Could someone recommend a program to evaluate the collected data. @Eva, maybe we could use poolparty? Then we would have a real project to see how it works.

## And
It wasn't my aim to take allready the next meeting. But thanks for the pressure. I want finnish this project by end of November. So please do more of it!
